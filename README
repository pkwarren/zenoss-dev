Basic utilities used for Zenoss development.

USAGE
=====

1) Add this to your .bashrc/.profile:

alias zenv=<path_to_this_directory>/bin/zenv

or:

2) Add the bin directory from this checkout to your PATH.

If you use (1), then run 'zenv' with no arguments to work on trunk. See the
zenv command for more information on its usage.

If you use (2), then you can use any of the companion scripts in bin/
standalone or use 'zenv' to manage your Zenoss development environments.

CONFIGURATION
=============

For using the sandbox tools ('chsb', 'lssb', 'mergesb', 'mksb', 'rmsb'), you
will want to configure the following file (replace <your_username> with your
SVN username):

echo "svn_username = <your_username>" > ~/.zenossdev
