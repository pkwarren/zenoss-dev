# Entry point into a Zenoss development environment. This script will create
# a working area for a Zenoss release, and optionally check out the source code
# for the release. Once you are in the Zenoss environment (zenv) for a
# particular release, you have all of the appropriate Zenoss settings set in
# the environment (ZENHOME, INSTANCE_HOME, PYTHONPATH, PATH), however they are
# set in a subshell to not require changes to the overall user account. This
# allows for working in parallel on multiple releases.
# 
# Examples:
#   $ zenv
#   --> Launches an environment for developing Zenoss trunk code.
#   $ zenv 4.1.x
#   --> Launches an environment for developing Zenoss 4.1.x branch code.
#   $ zenv 4.1.0
#   --> Launches an environment for developing on the Zenoss 4.1.0 tag.
#
# TODO:
# - Allow saving state of a Zenoss environment for quick repopulation of ZODB,
#   events and queues.
